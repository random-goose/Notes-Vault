# Inspirations

One Direction - Perfect
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms  
And if you like having secret little rendezvous  
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do

And if you like midnight driving with the windows down

Green Day - Hitchin' a Ride
The well that inebriates the guilt

Taylor Swift - Florida!!!
And this city wreaks of driving my self crazy

RHCP - Road Trippin'
Blue, you sit so pretty west of the one  
Sparkles light with yellow icing
just a mirror for the sun

Alphonse - Emetemito
I have no idea what the fuck is going on
On this slippery slope
heading out to the unknown

# Stuff am making up
Alphonse - Emetemito
I have no idea what the fuck is going on
On this slippery slope
heading out to the unknown
In the age of damnation
do you know if we're gonna-
do you have any idea?
do i know for shit?
wont stop our steps
lets venture out 
nomatter what happens
when you stand in front of me
i forget every facet of knowing
open the doors to heaven
is this happening?

You hopped into my life
my whole destiny
changed so much
