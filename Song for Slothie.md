# Inspirations

One Direction - Perfect
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms  
And if you like having secret little rendezvous  
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do

And if you like midnight driving with the windows down

Green Day - Hitchin' a Ride
The well that inebriates the guilt

Taylor Swift - Florida!!!
And this city wreaks of driving my self crazy

RHCP - Road Trippin'
Blue, you sit so pretty west of the one  
Sparkles light with yellow icing
just a mirror for the sun

Alphonse - Emetemito
I have no idea what the fuck is going on
On this slippery slope
heading out to the unknown

# Stuff am making up
I have no idea what the fuck is going on
On this slippery slope
heading out to the unknown
In the age of a river
wash up to the sea shore

do you think we're gonna-
you think that i've any idea?
cant let this stop
we trot our way
lets venture out 
no matter
we never stop
no place else
thats alright
just for right now
need you here
by my side
going out trill
paradise

when you stood in front of me,
i forgot every facet of be;
opened the doors to heaven
is this happening?

You hopped into my life
my whole deeesssssstiny
changed so much 
and if the sky was my diary
won't be enough for me to write
all of that

i just wanna talk to you
about birds and bees
and cotton candy
all the gossip
i wanna talk to you
day in and day out

while the city freaks
driving themselves crazy
with you i wanna be
driving with the windows down
and if you wanna stop
and have 

and all our secret little rendezvous
the 

but will the stories ever end?
can we continue that in our dreams?





you put the windows down

it was a wonderful scene
there was such a nice breeze
as you do your little tease
made me feel like
the king of seven seas
just you and me singing
all the countless melodies
when you stood in front of me
lost track of what could be

staring at my phone screen
itâ€™s in your smile, so heavenly
my inherent tendency
in effigy of husbandry
with our lasting legacy
make me hard like puberty
rock hard, like Tiffany
the sweet smell of victory
to my pain and agony,
you're the only remedy
sexy ass secretary
your forever devotee

a thousand miles apart we lay, but it's our love, and it's way
I know it sounds cray
and sometimes its gray
still you're my bae
no boundary we don't break
stare at you while I bake
you get the best cake
u say hol up let him cook
I just love the way you look
staring at you while you juke
hanging clothes on the hook
can I sneak a quick look
fuck Microsoft Outlook
i think you're gonna lost your mind
reading my shitty rhymes
please, I'm just a guy
your milkshake gonna bring me into the yard
sitting in class i finna prey
about tits and Courvoisier
