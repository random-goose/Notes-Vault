# Inspirations

One Direction - Perfect
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms  
And if you like having secret little rendezvous  
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do

And if you like midnight driving with the windows down

Green Day - Hitchin' a Ride
The well that inebriates the guilt

Taylor Swift - Florida!!!
And this city wreaks of driving my self crazy

RHCP - Road Trippin'
Blue, you sit so pretty west of the one  
Sparkles light with yellow icing
just a mirror for the sun

Alphonse - Emetemito
I have no idea what the fuck is going on
On this slippery slope
heading out to the unknown

# Stuff am making up
Alphonse - Emetemito
I have no idea what the fuck is going on
On this slippery slope
heading out to the unknown
In the age of a river
wash up to the sea shore

do you think we're gonna-
you think that i've any idea?
wont let this stop
we trot our way
lets venture out 
no matter what happens
we never stop
no place else
thats alright
just for right now
need you here

when you stood in front of me,
i forgot every facet of be;
open the doors to heaven
is this happening?

You hopped into my life
my whole deeesssssstiny
changed so much 
and if the sky was my diary
won't be enough for me to write
all of that

i just wanna talk to you
about birds and bees
and cotton candy
every gossip out there
i wanna talk to you
day in and day out

while the city freaks
driving themselves crazy
with you i wanna be
driving with the windows down
and if you wanna stop
and have 

and all our secret little rendezvous
the 

but will the stories ever end?
can we continue that in our dreams?
