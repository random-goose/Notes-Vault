It allows the users to access and store data on remote servers rather than devices on premises, which in theory provides flexibility, scalability, and savings

- On Demand: Users can provision computing resources as needed without using human intervention
- Broad Network access: servers can be accesses form anywhere via the internet
- Resource Pooling: Provides users with shared resources
- Scalable: Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand
- Measured: Cloud systems monitor and report the usage, allowing for cost optimization

### Applications
