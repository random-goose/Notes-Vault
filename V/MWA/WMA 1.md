## How a website works:
1. Enter a web address
2. Requests get sent to DNS Server
3. DNS looks up for the IPA of the server
4. Routes to the correct IPA; and uses HTTP/S to transmit the required information to the server
5. Sends the requested info to the page
6. Browser formats the webpage and displays it
