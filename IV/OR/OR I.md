## History of OR
OR is a field of study that emerged during the second world war due to the need to solve complex military issues using scientific techniques. It is a discipline that uses advanced analytical and mathematical techniques to improve decision-making and optimize complex systems and processes.

- World War II
	the need to optimize military operations, such as bombing operations, logistics and resources, drove the development of operations research. This led to the formation of special teams of scientists and mathematicians in the UK and later in the US to tackle these challenges
- The Cobb Report
	a significant event in the establishment of or as a distinct discipline was the Cobb report, authored by mathematician and statistician **Walter Cobb**. The report, titled "Scientific Methods in Bombing Operations", detailed how operations analysis contributed to the success of allied bombing campaigns during the war
- in 1948, the OR club was founded in the UK, which later became the OR society in 1953. This was the first professional organization dedicated to or. 
- The OR society of India was formed in 1957 and aims to promote the development and applications of or techniques in India.

## Types of OR Problems

OR deals with a wide range of problem types that can be found in various domains and industries

- Optimization Problems:
	- Linear Programming: Optimization of a linear objective function with linear constraints. Used for resource allocation, production planning, and portfolio optimization
	- Non-Linear Programming: Extends linear programming to handle non-linear objective functions and constraints, often arising in engineering, econ, & Science.
	- Integer Programming: Deals with optimization problems where all the problems must take integer values
	- Dynamic Programming: Deals with complex problems by breaking them into simpler sub-problems using a recursive approach, used for inventory management
	
- Network Flow Problems: To optimize the flow of goods, services, or information through a network, like transportation problem
- Goal Programming: Addresses situations where multiple conflicting goals need to be balanced, allowing for trade-offs and prioritization
- Game Theory: Analyze competitive situations where the outcome depends on the actions of multiple decision-makers
