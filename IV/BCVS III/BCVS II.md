# Culture Shock
It is the feeling of disorientation, discomfort, or anxiety that people experience when they move to a new cultural environment. This phenomenon occurs due to the differences between the familiar culture and the new one, which can affect various aspects of daily life. 

## Phases of Culture Shock:
### Honeymoon Phase
Initially, the new culture may seem exciting or fascinating. 
### Frustration Phase
As the novelty wears off, challenges and frustrations begin to emerge. Language barriers, misunderstandings, and difference in social norms can lead to feelings of infuriation, and homesickness
### Adjustment Phase
Gradually, people start to adapt to the new culture. They learn to understand the people better, understand local customs, and develop routines that make daily life easier
### Acceptance Phase
Eventually, individuals reach a level of comport and acceptance. They feel more at home in the new culture, can navigate it more easily, and may even start to see it as part of their identity.

## Example
In India when you ask for help, you can be direct to the point, but in the US people tend to make some talk and greetings before they get to the point
