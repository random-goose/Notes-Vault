1.	Design a DFA that accepts set of all strings beginning with 1 which interpreted as binary representation of an integer, is congruent to zero modulo 5 over {0,1}.

2.Design a DFA that accepts set of all strings which interpreted as ternary representation of an integer, is congruent to zero modulo 5.

3. Describe the phases of compiler with the following example.
C[i][j]=C[i][j]+A[i][k]*B[k][j];

4. Describe the phases of compiler with the following example (rate is float value).
Position: =initial  + rate * 60;

5. Prove or disprove that the following is an LL(1) grammar. 
G:  S → (L) | a,
L → L,S | S

6. Verify whether the following grammar is LL (1) or not.
SiEtS 
SiEtSeS
S a
E b

7.Construct SLR parsing table for the following grammar
S-->CC    
C-->aC | b

8. Construct SLR parsing table for the following grammar
S-> AaAb/BbBa
A->a
B->b

9.Construct precedence relation table for the following grammar
E → E+T / T  
T → T*F / F  
F → (E) / id 

10. Construct precedence relation table for the following grammar
bexpr  bexpr or bterm | bterm
bterm  bterm and bfactor | bfactor
bfactor  not bfactor | (bexpr) | true | false

11. Consider the following grammar
S –> TL; 
T –> int | float 	
L –> L, id | id 
Parse the input string  ”float id, id, id;”  using shift reduce parser
	
12.Explain about LEADING( ) and  TRAILING( ) functions with example.
